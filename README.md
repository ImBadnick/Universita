The Master in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering is an advanced, comprehensive two-year program designed to equip students with a deep understanding of the concepts, technologies, and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and data engineering. With a strong emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical skills, the program offers a unique blend of AI, machine learning, data mining, large-scale databases, cloud computing, and business management.

In the first year, students will learn about key AI technologies and concepts, including data mining and machine learning, large-scale and multi-structured databases, and cloud computing. The first semester is heavily focused on the foundations of data management and machine learning. In the second semester, students are introduced to business and project management concepts, optimization methods, and game theory. Elective courses from Group A allow students to further specialize in their areas of interest.

The second year builds upon this foundation, with a focus on more advanced topics such as computational intelligence, deep learning, process mining, and multimedia information retrieval. Students also delve into the exciting field of computer vision, and have the option to further tailor their learning with a free-choice elective course. The year culminates with a research thesis, allowing students to apply their learned skills to a significant project in AI and data engineering.

The program integrates hands-on lab experiences and projects that provide students with practical application of theoretical concepts. It also exposes students to the ethical, societal, and business dimensions of AI and data engineering.

Prerequisites for some courses ensure a structured learning path and enable students to progressively build up their skills and knowledge throughout the program.

Upon completion of this MSc program, students will be well-prepared for a variety of roles in the AI and data engineering field, from AI specialists and data scientists to consultants and project managers in tech firms, start-ups, and research institutions.
